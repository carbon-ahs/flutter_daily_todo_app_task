# Daily Todo App

A new Flutter Todo project.

The application consists of two sub-activities:
1. To-Do List
    - In the To-Do List the user should be able to add/remove item headings, details and due dates
    - The user should be able to complete the task if completed
    - There should be an in-app notification/alert when the due date is the current date
2. Sensor Tracking
    - There should be 2 graphs that are continuously showing real-time data of the gyro and accelerometer sensors mentioned.
    - If there is very high movement on any two axis' at the same time, please create an alert that says "ALERT"
